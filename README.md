# QlikConnectors

This is a QVX wrapper for Qlik Sense

Anyone can build their own driver by implementing the IQlikConnector interface and this without recompiling the whole project. The generated driver can then be deployed in the "connectors" directory.

An installer is provided with an example JSON driver:
